 # Messages configuration
 # 
 # 
 # In most cases, the variables inside the default messages are those available
 # in that specific message. The exception to this is messages which are related
 # to a certain punishment.
 # 
 # When message has an associated punishment, multiple variables are available:
 # 
 # %ID% - punishment ID number
 # %TYPE% - punishment type, e.g. 'Ban'
 # %TYPE_VERB% - punishment type as a verb, e.g. 'Banned'
 # %VICTIM% - display name of the victim of the punishment
 # %VICTIM_ID% - identifier of victim, like the target player's UUID
 # %OPERATOR% - display name of the staff member who made the punishment
 # %OPERATOR_ID% - identifier of the operator, like the staff member's UUID
 # %UNOPERATOR% - staff member undoing the punishment. available only when the punishment is undone
 # %UNOPERATOR_ID% - identifier of staff member undoing the punishment, like the staff members' UUID
 # %REASON% - reason for the punishment
 # %SCOPE% - scope of the punishment
 # %DURATION% - original duration (how long the punishment was made for)
 # %START_DATE% - the date the punishment was created
 # %TIME_PASSED% - the time since the punishment was created
 # %TIME_PASSED_SIMPLE% - the time since the punishment was created, rounded to the biggest time unit possible (e.g. 2 months instead of 1 month 23 days)
 # %END_DATE% - the date the punishment will end, or formatting.permanent-display.absolute for permanent punishments
 # %TIME_REMAINING% - the time until the punishment ends, or formatting.permanent-display.relative for permanent punishments
 # %TIME_REMAINING_SIMPLE% - the time until the punishment ends, rounded to the biggest time unit possible (e.g. 10 days instead of 9 days 13 hours)
 # %HAS_EXPIRED% - Shows if a punishments duration has run out. Does not check if the punishment is revoked!
 # %TRACK% - the escalation track of the punishment, for example if you are using layouts
 # %TRACK_ID% - the ID of the escalation track
 # %TRACK_NAMESPACE% - the namespace of a track can be used by other plugins to implement their own layouts
 # 
 # The following variables have limited availability:
 # %TARGET% - the original target argument of a command. For example, in '/ipban Player1', %TARGET% is Player1
 # %PAGE% - the number of the current page in a list
 # %NEXTPAGE% - the number of the next page
 # %LASTPAGE% - the number of the last page
 # %NEXTPAGE_KEY% - a code which if used with the command, shows the next page
 # %LASTPAGE_KEY% - a code which if used with the command, shows the last page
 # (%PREVIOUSPAGE% - a deprecated equivalent for %LASTPAGE%)
 # 
 # Pagination can be absolute or relative depending on which variables you use. For example, the %NEXTPAGE_KEY%
 # and %LASTPAGE_KEY% variables provide special codes which, when used with the command, switch to the next page.
 # These are designed to be used with 'click events' so that staff can easily click to move between pages.
 # Please note that this feature is based on relative browsing of the page results, which means that a page represents
 # a "place" in the list and not really an absolute page number.
